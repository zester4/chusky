# Kernel CLI

The Kernel CLI provides command-line access to Kernel's cloud browser platform for browser automation, serverless app deployment, and infrastructure management.

## Installation

- Homebrew: `brew install kernel/tap/kernel`
- npm: `npm install -g @onkernel/cli`

Verify with `kernel --version`. Use `kernel <command> --help` as the source of truth for the installed version.

## Authentication

- **Preferred:** Set `KERNEL_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Fallback:** Run `kernel login` for interactive OAuth

## Quick Start

```bash
# Authenticate
export KERNEL_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Create a browser session
kernel browsers create -o json

# Run Playwright automation (use `return` to get a value back)
kernel browsers playwright execute <session_id> '
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  return await page.evaluate(() => document.title);
'

# Take a screenshot
kernel browsers computer screenshot <session_id> --to screenshot.png

# Cleanup
kernel browsers delete <session_id>
```

## Safe Operation

- Prefer `-o json` plus `jq` for scripts; deploy and invoke emit JSONL rather than one JSON object.
- Use `--project <id-or-name>` or `KERNEL_PROJECT` when an API key can access multiple projects.
- Keep confirmation prompts for destructive operations unless non-interactive execution is intentional.
- Delete created browser sessions and pools after testing. Never echo, log, commit, or share API keys, credentials, or proxy passwords.

## Project, API Key, and Organization Administration

```bash
# Rename, archive, or reactivate a project (provide at least one update)
kernel projects update <id-or-name> --name <new-name> -o json
kernel projects update <id-or-name> --status archived -o json
kernel projects update <id-or-name> --status active -o json

# Look up a soft-deleted API key
kernel api-keys get <id> --include-deleted -o json

# Inspect limits before changing the default project cap
kernel org limits get -o json
kernel org limits set --default-project-max-concurrent-sessions <n> -o json
```

For `org limits set`, `0` removes the default cap; the value cannot exceed the organization concurrency limit.

Rotate an API key interactively with `kernel api-keys rotate <id>`. Use `--days-to-expire <1-3650>` to set the replacement key lifetime and `--expire-in-days <n>` to set the old key's grace period (default 7 days; `0` revokes it immediately). The output contains the replacement plaintext key once: keep it out of logs, migrate callers during the grace period, and then verify the old key no longer works.
